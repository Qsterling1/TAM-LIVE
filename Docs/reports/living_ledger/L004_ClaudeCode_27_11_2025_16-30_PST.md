## ACTIONS LOG

### [16:30] PROTOCOL FAILURE DETECTED & CORRECTED
**Error:** Initial execution violated naming convention (Section 3.1)
**Correction Actions:**
1. Re-read `_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` - identified correct naming: `L[Number]_[AgentName]_[DD]_[MM]_[YYYY]_[HH]-[MM]_[TimeZone].md`
2. Found existing `L003_ShadowRunner2.5...` (DIFFERENT agent) - archived to `living_ledger_archive/`
3. Deleted incorrectly named `Session_L004...` file
4. Created THIS file with correct naming convention

### [16:20-16:30] Phase 1: Pre-Flight Check (Alignment)
**Action:** Read `_ALIGNMENT_AND_ASSIGNMENT.md`
**Outcome:** ✅ Confirmed understanding of:
- Director's accessibility requirements (Speech-to-Text input, TTS output, visual clarity)
- Agent role: Internal Builder within IDE
- Transparency protocol and ledger maintenance mandate
- Quality standards and "Stop & Ask" rule

### [16:21-16:30] Phase 2: Context Check (Memory)
**Action:** Read `project_ledger.md` (Master Ledger)
**Outcome:** ✅ Downloaded project history:
- L001: Genesis - TAM evolution (v1→v4), OBS Virtual Camera pivot, "Lego Block" approach
- L002: The Great Reset - Burned down `LiveDirection`, established SSOT protocols
- L003: Protocol Compliance Test - Directory structure created, ledgers filed

**Action:** Check for active Session Ledger
**Outcome:**
- Found `L003_ShadowRunner2.5...` (DIFFERENT AGENT)
- ARCHIVED to `living_ledger_archive/` per protocol (Phase 2, line 32)
- Created THIS file (`L004_ClaudeCode_27_11_2025_16-30_PST.md`)

### [16:32] Directory Structure Verification
**Action:** Verify compliance with `_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` naming and structure
**Status:**
- ✅ `Single_Source_of_Truth/` exists with all SSOT documents
- ✅ `Docs/reports/living_ledger/` contains THIS file only
- ✅ `Docs/reports/living_ledger_archive/` contains L002, L003
- ✅ `Docs/reports/audits/` exists (empty)

### [16:33] Ledger Filing Verification
**Historical Ledgers Status:**
- L001: Content preserved in `project_ledger.md` (physical file lost in L003)
- L002: Archived at `Docs/reports/living_ledger_archive/L002_ShadowRunner2.5_11_27_2025_14-35_PST.md` ✅
- L003: Archived at `Docs/reports/living_ledger_archive/L003_ShadowRunner2.5_11_27_2025_15-58-PST.md` ✅

### Execution Results:

✅ **Read _WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md**
- Read and understood mandatory cascade sequence
- Confirmed status indicators
- Applied correct naming convention after initial error

✅ **Directory Tree Built/Verified**
